          <h3>Some Important Points About Life Of Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, as Mohandas Karamchand
              Gandhi. Karamchand was the name of his father. The honorific title
              Mahatma, or "Great Soul," was given to him in 1914.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi is often called Bapu in India, a term of endearment that
              means "father".
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi fought for much more than independence. His causes included
              civil rights for women, the abolition of the caste system, and the
              fair treatment of all people regardless of religion. His mother
              and father had different religious traditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi demanded fair treatment for the untouchables, India’s
              lowest caste; he underwent several fasts to support the cause. He
              called the untouchables harijans, which means "children of God".
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi ate fruit, nuts, and seeds for five years but switched back
              to strict vegetarianism after suffering health problems. He
              maintained that each person should find their own diet that works
              best. Gandhi spent decades experimenting with food, logging the
              results, and tweaking his eating choices. He wrote a book named
              The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi took an early vow to avoid milk products (including ghee),
              however, after his health began to decline, he relented and
              started drinking goat’s milk. He sometimes traveled with his goat
              to ensure that the milk was fresh and that he wasn’t given cow or
              buffalo milk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Government nutritionists were called in to explain how Gandhi
              could go 21 days without food.
            </li>
            <li>
              The British government wouldn't allow official photos of Gandhi
              while he was fasting, for fear of further fueling the push for
              independence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi was actually a philosophical anarchist and wanted no
              established government in India. He felt that if everyone adopted
              nonviolence and a good moral code they could be self-governing.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of Mahatma Gandhi's most outspoken political critics was
              Winston Churchill.
            </li>
            <li>
              Through a prearranged marriage, Gandhi was wed at age 13; his
              wife, Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia, was one year older. They were
              married 62 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi and his wife had their first child when he was 16 years
              old. That child died a few days later, but the couple did have
              four sons before he took a vow of celibacy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite being famous for nonviolence and involvement in the Indian
              independence movement, Gandhi actually recruited Indians to fight
              for Britain during World War I. He opposed India's involvement in
              World War II.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi's wife died in 1944 while imprisoned in the Aga Khan
              Palace. Her day of death (February 22) is celebrated as Mother's
              Day in India. Gandhi was also in prison at the time of her death.
              Gandhi was released from prison only because he contracted
              malaria, and British officials feared an uprising if he, too, died
              while in prison.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi attended law school in London and was famous among the
              faculty for his bad handwriting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mahatma Gandhi’s image has appeared on all denominations of Indian
              rupees printed since 1996.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi lived for 21 years in South Africa. He was imprisoned there
              many times as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi denounced Gandhism and did not want to create a cult-like
              following. He also conceded that he had “...nothing new to teach
              the world. Truth and nonviolence are as old as the hills.”
            </li>
            <li>
              Gandhi was assassinated by a fellow Hindu on January 30, 1948, who
              shot him three times at point-blank range. More than two million
              people attended Gandhi’s funeral. The epitaph on his memorial in
              New Delhi reads "Oh God" which are purported to be his last words.
            </li>
            <li>
              An urn that once contained Mahatma Gandhi's ashes is now at a
              shrine in Los Angeles, California.
